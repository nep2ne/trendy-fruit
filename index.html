      Watermelons are a sweet, popular fruit of summer, usually consumed fresh in slices. The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or striped, and the flesh can be red or pink (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.

      <h2>Starfruit</h2>
      <p>
        The fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually five but can sometimes vary); when cut in cross-section, it resembles a star, hence its name. The entire fruit is edible and is usually eaten out of hand.
